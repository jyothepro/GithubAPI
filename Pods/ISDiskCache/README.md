[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ishkawa/ISDiskCache.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ishkawa/ISDiskCache)

LRU disk cache for iOS.

## Requirements

- iOS 4.3 or later
- ARC

## Features

- deletes old files automatically using accessed date.
- accepts any type of object for key and value as long as it conforms to `NSCoding`.

## Usage

### Saving object to file

```objectivec
[[ISDiskCache sharedCache] setObject:object forKey:@"http://example.com"];
```

### Loading object from file

```objectivec
[[ISDiskCache sharedCache] objectForKey:@"http://example.com"];
```

### Set limit of size

```objectivec
[ISDiskCache sharedCache].limitOfSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB
```

When total size of disk cache is over limit of size, `ISDiskCache` calls `removeOldObjects` automatically.
This method sorts files by `NSFileModificationDate` and remove files from oldest file.
`NSFileModificationDate` is updated in each `objectForKey:`, so modification date equals to accessed date.

## Installing

Add `ISDiskCache/ISDiskCache.{h,m}` to your Xcode project.

### CocoaPods

If you use CocoaPods, you can install ISDiskCache by inserting config below.

```
pod 'ISDiskCache', :git => 'https://github.com/ishkawa/ISDiskCache.git'
```

## Note

### Synchronicity

You should pay attetion to that `ISDiskCache` works synchronously.
If you call APIs on main thread, it will causes blocking user interaction.
To avoid this, you should call APIs of `ISDiskCache` asynchronously.
Recommended solution of this issue is using APIs in `NSOperation` which loads data from server.
Another solution is calling APIs in dispatch queue like below.

```objectivec
dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0);
dispatch_async(queue, ^{
    UIImage *image = [diskCache objectForKey:URL];
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
        cell.imageView.image = image;
    });
});
```

See `ISViewController` of demo app for more example.

### Using ISMemoryCache together

If you want to use fast cache together, use [ISMemoryCache](https://github.com/ishkawa/ISMemoryCache).

```objectivec
UIImageView *imageView;
NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com"];

imageView.image = [[ISMemoryCache sharedCache] objectForKey:URL];
if (imageView.image == nil && [[ISDiskCache sharedCache] hasObjectForKey:URL]) {
    dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0);
    dispatch_async(queue, ^{
        UIImage *image = [diskCache objectForKey:URL];
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
            cell.imageView.image = image;
        });
    });
}
```

### Algorithm in generating file path from key

`ISDiskCache` uses MD5 hash to obtain file path from key.

```objectivec
NSData *data = [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:key];
unsigned char result[16];
CC_MD5([data bytes], [data length], result);
NSString *fileName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X",
        result[0], result[1], result[2], result[3], result[4], result[5], result[6], result[7],
        result[8], result[9], result[10], result[11],result[12], result[13], result[14], result[15]];
```
